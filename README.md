# Vibe: An Innovative Hangout Management System

Vibe outlays an innovative solution to hangout management in the modern era. It allows its user to spend more time hangout rather than coordinating everyone to hangout. Vibe accomplishes this through considering a userâ€™s pre-committed events and picks a time that it believes would result in the maximum likelihood of the most people showing. Vibe provides other functionality as exploring nearby events, forming groups, adding friends, and much much more.

This document is written to provide some insight in the development of Vibe.
